# Project64-MPN Troubleshooting

This guide covers common issues you might encounter while setting up or playing Mario Party 1-3 netplay with Project64-MPN.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: I already have PJ64, do I need to download it again?

**A**: Yes. This guide provides a version of the emulator geared specifically for netplay, and it's incompatible with other versions.

### Q: How can I reduce netplay lag?

**Solutions**:
- Increase lag using `/lag x` command
- Close any other programs using internet (web browsers, Skype, etc.)
- Make sure no one on the same network is using the internet (family, roommates)
- Seek out other users with nearby region tags
- Ensure it's actually netplay lag by having each player test FPS locally

**About Lag/Buffer**:
- Lag/Buffer refers to the amount of frames of input delay
- The larger it is, the more smoothly the game will run (provided all players can run the game fine offline)
- You can set it mid-game using `/lag x`
- Always set it to the lowest value that gives you a smooth framerate to reduce unnecessary input delay

### Q: The game's graphics are bad! Can I make them look better?

**A**: The resolution and anti-aliasing of a game can be changed without issue, though it's not recommended as the emulation will require more resources. If you want to edit these options, load a splitscreen Mini-Game such as MP2's Shell Shocked offline and confirm the game speed does not decrease.

### Q: What Video Plugin should I use?

**A**:
- **GLideN64** for Windows
- **Jabo's** if you have trouble with GLideN64
- **Rice** for macOS

## Connection Issues

### Can't connect to traversal server

**Problem**: Unable to connect to play64.com servers.

**Solutions**:
- Try different server regions (new-york.play64.com, etc.)
- Use P2P connection instead
- Check your firewall settings
- Ensure your internet connection is stable

### P2P connection issues

**Problem**: Can't connect via P2P or host P2P games.

**Solutions**:
- Ensure port forwarding is set up correctly (port 27886)
- Check Windows Firewall settings for both TCP and UDP rules
- Verify your public IP address is correct
- Make sure your router supports UPnP or manual port forwarding

## Controller Issues

### Xbox controller not working properly

**Problem**: Xbox controller inputs not registering correctly.

**Solution**: 
- Make sure the **XInput** option is checked in N-Rage Input Plugin V2: 2.3c's configuration
- Reconfigure your controller settings

### GameCube controller issues

**Problem**: Shoulder button issues or random inputs with GameCube controller.

**Solution**: 
- Use the **Direct-Input8** input plugin instead of the default
- This is included as an option specifically for GameCube controller users

### Multiple controllers on same computer

**Problem**: Issues with multiple people playing from the same computer.

**Solutions**:
- Make sure everyone playing has only the controller they're using plugged in
- Configure each controller separately in the input plugin
- Ensure the host allows multiple ports if needed

## Game Issues

### Save file conflicts

**Problem**: Save file mismatch warnings or corrupted saves.

**Solutions**:
- Every player must have the same save file for saving to work
- Always say **Y** when prompted unless you are mid-game
- Select **Replace Save Files** from the emulator's Netplay tab before every party
- Download fresh save files if corruption occurs

### Desync or crashing

**Problem**: Game desyncs or crashes during netplay.

**Solutions**:
- Use `/map 1:<controller_port>` to change controller ports
- Restart the netplay session
- Ensure all players have the same ROM versions
- Check that everyone's settings match

### Black screen on game window

**Problem**: Game window shows black screen.

**Solution**: This is normal behavior - use the pop-up netplay window to control the game.

## Performance Issues

### Poor graphics performance

**Problem**: Game runs slowly or graphics are poor.

**Solutions**:
- Try different video plugins (GLideN64 recommended for Windows)
- Lower resolution and anti-aliasing settings
- Close other programs using system resources
- Test performance offline first

### Input lag

**Problem**: Excessive input delay during gameplay.

**Solutions**:
- Adjust lag settings using `/lag x` command
- Disable autolag if needed
- Check network connection quality
- Ensure all players have good local performance

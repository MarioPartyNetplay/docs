# Project64-MPN Setup Guide

This guide will help you set up Project64-MPN to play Mario Party 1, 2, and 3 online with friends.

## Step 1: Download the Emulator

Download and extract the Project64-MPN build from: https://pastebin.com/raw/BicS7cGC

This download contains our custom netplay build, which includes:
- 100% saves
- Optimized netplay settings
- Game-enhancing codes
- And more!

## Step 2: Gather Your Games

Obtain ROM files for the games you want to play. The following games are supported:
- Mario Party (USA).n64
- Mario Party 2 (USA).n64
- Mario Party 3 (USA).n64

If you need help ripping your ROMs, try asking Google for advice.

## Step 3: Set Up the Emulator

1. Drag the Project64 MPN folder out of the download and keep it wherever you like
2. Launch it using `Project64-MPN.exe`
3. Right-click and select **Choose ROM Directory** and select the directory where your games are located (the `Games/` directory is included on Windows for convenience)
4. Go to **Options** > **Configure Controller Plugin** and select **N-Rage Input Plugin V2: 2.3c**
5. Configure it to suit your needs and click **OK**

## Step 4: Netplay Usage

### Accessing Netplay

1. Launch Project64-MPN
2. Double-click your game to access the netplay window
3. The game window is supposed to be black - use the pop-up window to host a party or connect to your fellow partiers

### Connecting to Other Players

#### Traversal Server

**Host**: Double-click the play64.com server you want on the top-right to host a room and create a `/join play64.com/xxxxx` key, then share the key with your guests.

**Guest**: `/join new-york.play64.com/xxxxx`

If the connection isn't acceptable, refer to P2P.

#### P2P (Peer-to-Peer)

If you plan to host a P2P lobby for others to join, you must have a port forwarded.

**Host**: `/host [forwarded port]`

**Guest**: `/join <host public IP> [host forwarded port]`

If no one in your group can port forward, refer to the Traversal section above.

### Starting the Game

Once everyone is together, you may start the party using `/start`. In case of crashing or desync, please redo the previous step.

## Port Forwarding

If you plan to host P2P, you'll need to forward a port. This will be the one you use to host parties. Players other than the host do not need to forward a port to join a host.

<Tip>
**TIP 1**: Make sure your firewall allows inbound connections!

Windows Firewall > Advanced settings > Inbound Rules > New Rule > Port. Make two separate rules for port 27886*, both TCP and UDP.

**TIP 2**: Set a static IP address if you don't already have one!
</Tip>

## Important Notes

- Every player must have the same save file for saving to work. You will be nagged if this is an issue. Be sure to always say Y unless you are mid-game. Alternatively, be sure to select **Replace Save Files** from the emulator's Netplay tab to replace the saves before every party you play.
- If you're using or emulating an Xbox controller, make sure the **XInput** option is checked in N-Rage Input Plugin V2: 2.3c's configuration.
- The input plugin N-Rage's **Direct-Input8** is included as an option for users of the GameCube controller who may experience shoulder button issues or random inputs with the default input plugin.
- Player order is decided by the order of the netplay room. In case of desync or crashing, you can change your controller port using `/map 1:<controller_port>`
- Make sure everyone playing has only the controller they're using plugged in.
- It's possible for multiple people to play from the same computer as long as the controllers they're using are plugged in.
- It's possible to host a room for 4 other people as long as the host disables their controller in PJ64.
- Lag is an unfortunate but necessary part of netplay. By default, autolag will increase and decrease input buffer as needed to make the game run as smoothly as possible without introducing excessive input delay. If desired, you can type `/lag x` to adjust the lag manually and disable autolag.
- The emulator's Netplay tab includes **Update Emulator**, which will add new features for Mario Party and other multiplayer games as we approve them. You can keep an eye on our Discord server's #news channel for posts about us adding new content. You will also be nagged if an update is available.

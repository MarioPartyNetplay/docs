# Dolphin-MPN Troubleshooting

This guide covers common issues you might encounter while setting up or playing Mario Party 4-8 netplay with Dolphin-MPN.

## Connection Issues

### Can't connect to traversal lobby

**Problem**: Dolphin stalls when trying to join someone's traversal lobby.

**Solution**: 
- You may only be able to connect to lobbies hosted over Direct Connect
- Either have the player unable to connect host the traversal lobby themselves
- Or have the host forward a port and host over Direct Connect
- If you need help forwarding a port, try following [this guide](https://portforward.com/)

### Direct Connect vs Traversal Server

**When to use Direct Connect**:
- When the traversal server is down
- For players who have trouble with the traversal server at all times
- May be the only way to play for some users

## Game Issues

### Black screen during emulation

**Problem**: The game shows up as a black screen when starting netplay.

**Solution**: 
- The black screen is caused by players not starting emulation at the same time
- Ensure that no one in the lobby is running the game before the host starts netplay

### Board went black during Mario Party

**Problem**: The board went black while playing Mario Party.

**Solution**: 
- In-game, quit out of the party and try again
- If you've been saving every turn, no progress will be lost

### Frame 0 desync

**Problem**: Someone desynced on frame 0.

**Solution**: 
- A frame 0 desync means there's a checksum mismatch
- All players should have the same game version
- Verify your game files match the required checksums

## Performance Issues

### Reducing netplay lag

**Solutions**:
- Increase buffer settings
- Close any other programs using internet (web browsers, Skype, etc.)
- Make sure no one on the same network is using the internet (family, roommates)
- Seek out players from nearby regions
- Ensure it's actually netplay lag by having each player test FPS locally

**About Buffer/Lag**:
- Buffer refers to the amount of frames of input delay
- The larger it is, the more smoothly the game will run (provided all players can run the game fine offline)
- You can set it mid-game
- Always set it to the lowest value that gives you a smooth framerate to reduce unnecessary input delay

### Graphics performance

**Problem**: The game's graphics are bad or performance is poor.

**Solution**:
- The resolution and anti-aliasing can be changed without issue
- However, it's not recommended as emulation will require more resources
- If you want to edit these options, load a splitscreen Mini-Game such as MP6's Circuit Maximus offline and confirm the game speed does not decrease

## Save File Issues

### Corrupted save files

**Problem**: Save file is corrupted.

**Solution**:
- Try formatting the data
- Or redownload the saves from the Dolphin-MPN package

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: I already have Dolphin, do I need to download it again?

**A**: Ideally yes, this guide provides a version of the emulator geared specifically for netplay, but as long as the host is using our build, any modern Dolphin build should be able to connect.

### Q: How do I use the GameCube Mic accessory over netplay?

**A**: Mic compatibility is currently not possible over netplay.

### Q: How do I play Mario Party 7's Deluxe Cruise mode over netplay?

**A**: 8-player netplay is currently not possible over netplay.

### Q: Multiple people on same computer?

**A**: It's possible for multiple people to play from the same computer as long as the controllers they're using are plugged in and the host allows them use of multiple ports.

### Q: Hosting for 4 other people?

**A**: It's possible to host a room for 4 other people as long as the host disables their controller in Dolphin.

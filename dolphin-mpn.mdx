# Dolphin-MPN Setup Guide

This guide will help you set up Dolphin-MPN to play Mario Party 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 online with friends.

## Step 1: Download the Emulator

Download and extract the appropriate version for your system:

- **Windows**: [Dolphin-MPN for Windows](https://github.com/MarioPartyNetplay/Dolphin-MPN/releases/latest/download/DolphinMPN-win32.zip)
- **macOS**: [Dolphin-MPN for macOS](https://github.com/MarioPartyNetplay/Dolphin-MPN/releases/latest/download/DolphinMPN-darwin.zip)
- **Linux/Steam Deck**: [Dolphin-MPN for Linux](https://github.com/MarioPartyNetplay/Dolphin-MPN/releases/latest/download/DolphinMPN-linux.flatpak)

<Note>
The macOS build runs under Rosetta 2 on Apple Silicon machines. While Apple Silicon compilation would be nice, it breaks netplay compatibility.
</Note>

This download contains our custom netplay build, which includes:
- 100% saves
- Optimized netplay settings
- Game-enhancing codes
- And more!

## Step 2: Gather Your Games

Obtain ISO or RVZ files for the games you want to play. The following games are supported:
- Mario Party 4
- Mario Party 5
- Mario Party 6
- Mario Party 7
- Mario Party 8
- Mario Party 9

<Warning>
Only version 1.01 of Mario Party 4 and version 1.02 of Mario Party 8 are supported. If you have another version of Mario Party 4, you can use the converter included in the Extras folder of the download.
</Warning>

### Game Checksums

Make sure your ISOs match the following checksums:

| Game | Checksum |
|------|----------|
| Mario Party 4 (USA) (v1.01).iso | `01de13ad52f1554975e7f316370ba086` |
| Mario Party 5 (USA).iso | `6b3699ee1f18447c4b2fabb3dd2ebf39` |
| Mario Party 6 (USA).iso | `010dece78287bcb8cafdeb15f035127a` |
| Mario Party 7 (USA).iso | `bd367c67fca5d93e581a43d1f61f4514` |
| Mario Party 8 (USA) (v1.02).iso | `944c3f7db81170c9d86fc73dab1da24b` |
| Mario Party 9 (USA) (En,Fr,Es).iso | `a9aa140b48e67ccdba9c7c9afc9884bc` |

You can confirm your checksums by right-clicking on the game and selecting **Properties** > **Verify** > **Verify Integrity**.

## Step 3: Set Up the Emulator

1. Drag the Dolphin MPN folder out of the download and keep it wherever you like
2. Launch it using `Dolphin-MPN.exe`

### GameCube Games Setup

1. Double-click the blank space where it says to pick your directory
2. Select the directory where your games are located (the `Games/` directory is included on Windows for convenience)
3. Go to **Controllers**
4. Under GameCube Controllers, select your controller from the drop-down menu next to Port 1
5. Click **Configure** to set up your controls

### Wii Games Setup

1. Go to **Controllers**
2. After marking **Emulate the Wii's Bluetooth adapter**, select your controller from the drop-down menu next to Wii Remote 1
3. Click **Configure** to set up your controls

## Step 4: Netplay Usage

### Accessing Netplay

1. Launch Dolphin-MPN
2. Click the **Online Play** button
3. Everyone needs to choose which player they'd like to be and configure their controls in that Wii Remote / GCN slot
4. All players must use a different slot

### Connecting to Other Players

**Joining a lobby:**
- The host should provide you their lobby's host code
- Enter the code to join

**Hosting a lobby:**
- Pick the **Host** tab
- Double-click the game you want to host
- Click **Copy** next to the room ID and give it to the players who will join you

### Setting up the Game

1. **Host**: Open **Assign Controllers/Wiimotes** from the netplay window and set each player to the decided player order (may be pre-set for GameCube titles)
2. Once everyone is together, the host may start the party using **Start**
3. In case of crashing or desync, make sure settings are shared and restart

## Important Notes

- The host's saves and cheats will be synced to all players before every game
- Player order is decided by the order of the netplay room by default
- The host can change controller ports in the netplay window
- Multiple people can play from the same computer as long as controllers are plugged in and the host allows multiple ports
- It's possible to host a room for 4 other people as long as the host disables their controller in Dolphin
- Lag is an unfortunate but necessary part of netplay - the host may use the Buffer selection to increase input buffer and make the game smoother
- If a save file is corrupted, try formatting the data or redownloading the saves
- Possible desyncs aren't always truly desyncs - keep playing to make sure if there was truly a desync before restarting
- Direct connect may be used even when the traversal server is down, and for players who have trouble with the traversal server at all times it may be the only way to play

## Supported Games

- Mario Party 4
- Mario Party 5
- Mario Party 6
- Mario Party 7
- Mario Party 8
- Mario Party 9
